Well, what a year 2020 was! Certainly nothing like anything that we expected. It has been terrifying for many of us. As well as instructive as to weaknesses of many things we thought we could depend on, especially of our leaders. But I think there are many positives we can point to. During this holiday season I plan to try to find at least one thing that day, that I am thankful for. I know during this difficult time I appreciate the support of family and friends, even when distanced socially. I hope everyone can stay safe and that 2021 is better than ever.
