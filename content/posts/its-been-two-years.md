It has been two years since I updated this. So many things have happened. I have tried my best as have the other members of my family to avoid coronavirus and to stop the spread. We got two nCov-2 Pfizer vaccines, and then we got two boosters (and a third for me). But even with all of that in late August 2022 we all had coronavirus. I was able to join a NIH RECOVER Study that researchers are trying to discover what the longterm effects of COVID-2019 are. So many things happening. Hopefully soon we can put this behind us, and that it won't be two years before I update this again!
